<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img align="center" src="public/repositories-demo.png">

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

## Test Suite

I started trying one test which is on the Search.js file where I just text for the text in the placeholder of the Search Bar.

In order to execute the tests, just run this on the terminal:
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

## Feedback

It has been a great learning experience as I had never used React, GraphQL or started testing on my own. I definitely wish to spend more time learning about testing for React and JS.
